            <p>Here's another quirk. there's no way to resize a frame
                 without removing it's layers first. Let us have an easy way 
                 to do it, like on another layer state like on Edit Shape, 
                 that let's you edit the size of group without harming the 
                 already fixed alignment of the layers first, if it's clipped,
                mismatch or offset, then so be it, so we wouldn't sweat every
                 now and then to remove them first and get them back in 
                </p>
